abstract: We study in this short note a counterpart to the quasilinear generalized parabolic Anderson model (gPAM) on the 2-dimensional torus where the coefficients are nonlocal functionals of the solution. Under a positivity assumption on the diffusion coefficient we give a local in time solution theory within the framework of paracontrolled calculus.
