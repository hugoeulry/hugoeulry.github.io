              I am mostly interested in the study of singular SPDEs using the tools from paracontrolled calculus. I defended my PhD thesis "Anderson stochastic quantization and paracontrolled calculus : stochastic PDEs in a singular environment." in June 2024 and am currently working  on related topics at UMPA, ENS Lyon, under the supervision of Nikolay Tzvetkov.
