              I am mostly interested in the study of singular SPDEs using the tools from paracontrolled calculus. I defended my PhD thesis "Anderson stochastic quantization and paracontrolled calculus : stochastic PDEs in a singular environment." in June 2024. Some of the results obtained during my PhD include:
              - a fine comparison property between the Green functions of the Anderson Hamiltonian and the usual Laplace Beltrami operator;
              - a variational construction of an invariant measure to the polynomial {{< math>}}$\Phi_2${{< /math>}} model driven by the Anderson operator;
              - a global solution theory for the same model starting from deterministic rough data;
              - probabilistic properties of the dynamics.

              Starting from September 2024, I work on related topics at UMPA, ENS Lyon, under the supervision of <a href="https://tzvetkov.perso.math.cnrs.fr/">Nikolay Tzvetkov</a>.
